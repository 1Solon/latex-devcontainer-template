## Usage

The template is made to be used with the DevContainer, to do so, open the project in Visual Studio Code and click the "Reopen in Container" button that appears in the bottom right corner of the window.

## Adding new packages

You can add new packages in two ways:

#### Manually (One-Time)

When inside the devcontainer, open the terminal and run the following command:

```bash
tlmgr install <package>
```

#### Automatically (Every Time)

First, navigate to [devcontainer.json](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) and add the following line to the `postCreateCommand` array:

```json
tlmgr install <package>
```

Note that by default, the template installs `tex-gyre` so, you should be able to install any other package by just including it after it. For example:

```json
tlmgr install tex-gyre <package>
```

## Structure

The template is slightly opinionated, but you can change it to fit your needs. In general:

* [structure.text](./structure.tex) contains any packages and config.
* [report.tex](./report.tex) is the main file.
* [pages](./pages/) contains the different sections of the report.
* [docs](./docs/) contains the output.
